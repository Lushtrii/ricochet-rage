# Ricochet Rage

![Game Demo](assets/demo.gif)

## Description

Ricochet Rage is a fast-paced shoot-'em-up with a twist—your bullets only deal real damage when they bounce off walls first! Master the art of the ricochet as you battle through 10 action-packed levels with progressing difficulty, facing off against powerful bosses on levels 5 and 10.

Your goal? Eliminate all enemies in each room to advance. But be careful—if you die, it's back to the very beginning! Luckily, power-ups spawn periodically to give you an edge, so use them wisely.

Do you have what it takes to clear all 10 levels and emerge victorious?
